## GearStar ENGINE (Godot 4 Engine)
GearStar Engine is a Engine that is being built on top of null Engine
We aim to have GearStar be a capable FnF Engine that can be flexable and modular, maybe not on the level of psych (yet), but still capable to work with without source code


## Plans
Our Current plans are to
- Rewrite some to most of the code of Null and make it more like other engines
- make our own mods with the engine once it is capable enough to make mods(FanGames) with source wise
- make the engine as modular to our abilities
- and many many more!
